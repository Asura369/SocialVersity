# Part II: List of Changes

Based on the Heuristic Evaluation (Nielsen's 10 Heuristics), the following changes were implemented in **GP3 Part 2 (Version 2)**:

## 1. User Control and Freedom
- **Added "Leave Group" Button**: Users can now leave groups they have joined.
- **Added "Delete Message" Button**: Users can delete their own messages in the chat.

## 2. Error Prevention
- **Confirmation Modals**: Implemented confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (Leaving a group, Deleting a message) to prevent accidental clicks.

## 3. Visibility of System Status
- **Toast Notifications**: Added a global toast system to provide immediate feedback when an action is successful (e.g., "Message deleted", "Left group successfully").

## 4. Recognition Rather Than Recall
- **Mobile Navigation in Messages**: Added a "Back" arrow in the mobile chat view to easily return to the inbox list, preventing users from getting stuck in a conversation.

## 5. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- **Dashboard Polish**: Optimized the spacing and font sizes of the "Welcome" section on mobile devices to reduce clutter and bring more content above the fold.

## 6. Help and Documentation
- **Map Help**: Added a "Help" button (?) on the Map page that opens a modal explaining how to interact with the map pins and buildings.
